    <h1>Angry Birds (video game)</h1>
    <p>Angry Birds (later remarketed as Angry Birds Classic) is a 2009 casual puzzle video game 
        developed by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, 
        the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices starting in December 2009.[1][2] Since 
        that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store,[5] 
        which prompted the developer to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most 
        notably Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded 
        to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and PCs. A sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released 
        in July 2015 for iOS and Android. Around April 2019, the game was removed from the App Store.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>In Angry Birds, the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve 
        their eggs, which have been stolen by a group of hungry green pigs.[11] In each stage of the 
        gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, 
        glass,[12] and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is 
        to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds 
        with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, 
        causing the blocks to collapse and pop the pigs.[13] The player must set the angle and force of 
        the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile 
        versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player 
        simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot 
        will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks 
        are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack 
        hard-to-reach pigs. Also hidden in the levels, players can unlock bonus levels by</p>
